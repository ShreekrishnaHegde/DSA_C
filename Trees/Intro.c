/*
->Parent Node: The node which is an immediate predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.
->Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node.  
->A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
->Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.
->Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node.
->Descendant: A node x is a descendant of another node y if and only if y is an ancestor of x.
->Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E} are called siblings.
->Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.
->Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
->Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.
->Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.
